# VISLOG APP (Visitor + Logbook)

This is an App to log visitor information to the designated venue or events. 
This project was developed as part of my Final Project for my 6-Months MERN Stack Bootcamp. 

The main features of this app:
  1. Visitor Log using QRCode
  2. Frequent visitors doesn't need to fill out the information form again if use from the same device to log in. 
  3. Venue owner / organiser can create multiple venues or events.
  4. Organiser also can fill in the information on behalf of the visitor.


The stack:
1. React + vite + Tailwind Css as front-end Library
2. ExpressJS + Postgres SQL as back-end
3. Deployment using Render.com

Repo back-end:
